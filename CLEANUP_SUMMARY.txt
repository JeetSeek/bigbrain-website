# Cleanup Summary - Manual Extraction Test Project

## Files to Keep (Core System)
✅ server/supabaseClient.js - Database connection
✅ server/index.js - Main backend API
✅ All frontend files - React app
✅ All existing fault code services
✅ MANUAL_EXTRACTION_README.md - Project documentation

## Files to Remove (Test/Experimental)
❌ server/services/PDFIntelligenceExtractor.js - Test extraction service
❌ server/scripts/processExistingManuals.js - Test processing script
❌ server/scripts/checkExtractionResults.js - Test results viewer
❌ Test database tables (will be recreated in new project)

## Database Tables to Clean
The following test tables will be KEPT but can be dropped in new project:
- manual_intelligence (10 test records)
- manual_content_intelligence (60 test chunks)
- gc_number_registry (6 test GC numbers)
- fault_code_manual_index (empty)
- manual_metadata (old test table)
- manual_content_chunks (old test table)
- manual_gc_mappings (old test table)

## Recommended Actions

1. Keep README for reference
2. Delete test scripts (listed above)
3. Keep database tables for now (reference data)
4. Start fresh project for production data extraction
5. Use lessons learned from this POC

## What Was Proven

✅ GC numbers CAN be extracted from PDFs
✅ Content CAN be chunked and made searchable
✅ Database schema works well
✅ Integration approach is sound

## What Needs Work

❌ Extraction patterns need refinement
❌ Need systematic testing across manufacturers
❌ Quality verification process needed
❌ Better error handling required
