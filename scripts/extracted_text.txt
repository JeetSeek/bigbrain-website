11 Installation and maintenance instructions ecoTEC exclusive 0020017768_05  4.3   Installation site  The site of erection of the boiler should allow proper connection of the air/exhaust ducting. In addition, there should be adequate room for maintenance work and air circulation around the boiler. The boiler can be installed in any room, however, in rooms with a bath or a shower, the special requirements of BS 7671 (IEE Regulations), the electro-technical stipulations of the Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations and, in IE, the current issue of IS 813 and the current ETCI Stipulations must especially be observed.  e   Danger! Danger of death by electric shock! If a room sealed boiler is installed in a room with a bath or a shower, the electrical switches and the boiler controller, which operate at mains voltage must be mounted in locations where any person in the bath or in the shower cannot reach them  In the event of installation in unusual locations, special provisions may have to be made. Detailed instructions for this can be found in BS 5546 and in BS 6798. The boiler must be installed on a flat vertical wall which is adequately robust to carry the weight of the boiler. It is possible to mount onto a wall made of flammable material if the regulations of the Local Authority and the legal building stipulations are fulfilled. In this case however, the unit would have to be mounted in a specially made enclosure. (You can also use an existing cabinet or existing enclosure as long as it can be modified accordingly to suit the new application.) Further details concerning the fundamental characteristics when modifying existing cabinets or enclosures, including the requirements for ventilation, are described in BS 6798. If the boiler is to be installed in a half-timbered house, the installation must be undertaken in accordance with the Institute of Gas Engineers Publication "IGE/UP/7 Edition 2 Gas installation in timber framed and light steel framed buildings". Please note the following instructions before choosing where to install the heater:  a   Caution! Do not install the appliance in rooms prone to frost. In rooms with aggressive steam or dust, the appliance must be operated independently of the ventilation!  When choosing the place of installation and while operating the appliance, make sure that the combustion air is free from chemical substances such as e.g. fluorine, chlorine, sulphur, ammonia etc. Sprays, solvents and cleaning agents, paints, adhesives etc. contain these kinds of substances, which - in the worst case scenario - can lead to corrosion, even in the exhaust system, during ambient air dependent operating of the appliance. Particularly in hairdessing salons, lacquering and finishing workshops, cleaning facilities, etc., the appliance must be operated independently of the ambient air. Otherwise, a separate installation room is required to guarantee that the combustion air supply is free from the above substances.  4.4   Required minimum gaps/assembly clearances  min min 5 min 5 min 500** min 145   165/246*  Fig. 4.3 Required minimum gaps/assembly clearances  The boiler must be mounted on a flat, vertical wall surface which is large enough for the boiler including the required minimum space requirement and the space required for assembly (Fig. 4.3).

In addition, the terminal should not be located closer than 150 mm from a wall-opening provided for e.g. a window.  Boundary flue terminations must as a minimum comply with Building regulation part „J“ 600 mm and should also be in accordance with the Guide to Condensing Boiler Installation which recommends 2.5 m from wall, fence or boundary. Where a plume diverter terminal is used this is measured in the direction of the flow of products. BS 5440–1: We recommend that the terminal of a fan-assisted flue pipe system be positioned as follows: a) At least 2 m from an opening in the building directly opposite, and b) so that the combustion products do not flow out at right angles to a boundry. 1)   Dimensions B, C and D: These dimensions can be reduced to 25 mm without having a negative effect on the output of the boiler. In order to prevent the products and condensation emission from impinging on any bordering surfaces, the terminal should be extended as shown in Fig. 5.10. 2) Dimension F: This dimension can be reduced to 25 mm without having a negative effect on the output of the boiler. In order to prevent the smoke and condensation emission from impinging on any bordering surfaces, however, a gap of 300 mm is recommended. For IE, recommendations are given in the current issue of the IS 813.  Fig. 5.10 Flue pipe terminating under balconies or gutters 5.8   Air connection  Detailed recommendations concerning air connection are given in BS 5440, Part 2. A ventilation opening in the room or inner room section where the boiler is installed is not required.  Ventilating a compartment or enclosure  The boilers have a very high energy efficiency. As a result of this, only small heat losses are produced at the casing of the appliance. For this reason, cabinets and enclosures in which the boiler is fitted do not need to have permanent ventilation openings at the top and bottom for cooling.  5 Installation

The drain pipe connected to the condensate drain of the boiler must have a constant gradient (45 mm per metre) and should be installed and terminate within the building to prevent the possibility of freezing up.  The condensate drain pipe should terminate in a suitable location, e.g.: a) The drain pipe should preferably terminate in the floor of the house in the ventilation duct (at least 450 mm above the duct base). There must be a siphon ( 3 ) fitted in the line (mounted in the boiler) producing a connection head of at least 75 mm of water. A ventilation valve ( 4 ) must be fitted in the drain pipe in front o f   the siphon. The connection to the ducting should not allow overflow into another drain pipe or allow overflow from another drain pipe into the condensate drain pipe. This can be achieved by keeping a gap between the pipe branches of at least 110 mm, with a duct diameter of 100 mm, and 250 mm with a duct diameter of 150 mm. b) Connection into the domestic waste water drain pipe (e.g. a sink or washing machine) with an external termination. The condensate drain pipe should have a minimum diameter of 22 mm, without length restriction, and also be fitted with a siphon ( 3 ) having a connection head of 75 mm (fitted within the boiler already). The connection should be made after the drain siphon if possible. If the installation is only possible in front of the siphon, there must be a ventilation valve between the two siphons. This is normally provided in a drain. c) Draining into a gully ( 5 ) under the grid ( 6 ) and above the water level. The external piping should be kept as short as possible to minimise the frost risk, and should be no longer than 3 m. d) To the condensate absorption point (drainage ditch)   (7 ). The external pipe should have a maximum length of 3 m. Further information can be obtained from "BS 6798 Specification for installation of gas–fired boilers of rated input not exceeding 70 kW net". The condense trap ( 1 ) must be filled with water as described in the relevant chapter before the boiler is commissioned.  5.10   Electrical connection  d   Danger! The electrical installation may only be undertaken by an authorised engineer. Risk of fatal electric shock from touching live connections. Always disconnect the power supply first by pulling the plug out of the wall socket. Only after this can the installation be undertaken.

Do not use any unsuitable frost or corrosion protection agents. 6.1.1   Filling and bleeding from the heating side  1  Fig. 6.1 Auto air vent Legend:  1   Auto air vent A water pressure/filling pressure between 1.0 and 2.0 bar is required for proper functioning of the boiler. If the heating installation operates over several floors, it may be necessary to have higher water levels on the pressure gauge. • Rotate the cap of the auto air vent ( 1 ) on the pump a couple of times to loosen it (the appliance is ventilated automatically by the auto air vent during continuous operation). • Open all radiator valves in the installation.  bar bar 1   2 3 4  Fig. 6.2 Check the filling pressure of the heating installation  h   Note! The ecoTEC units are supplied with a pressure gauge and a digital pressure display (2). Using the pressure gauge you can perform a quick check whether the filling pressure is within the prescribed range or not, even when the unit is switched off. With the unit switched on, you can read off the exact pressure by pushing the minus button „-“.  • Turn the rotary knobs ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) to the left hand stop and switch the unit on using the main switch ( 3 ).  h   Note! Use the test programme P.6 for filling the heating system: The priority changeover valve moves to the central position, the heating pump is not running and the unit does not go into heating mode, see Section 9.2. Note! To avoid running the system with too little water and thus to prevent damage, your appliance has a water pressure sensor. This signals the low pressure level if the level falls below 0.6 bar by the water pressure value in the display flashing. If the water pressure falls below 0.3 bar the unit switches off. The error message F.22 appears in the display. Fill the system up with water before you start up the appliance again. Filling the heating system:  2 1  Fig. 6.3 Filling the heating system  Proceed as follows to fill the system: • Open all radiator valves on the system. • Ensure that the boiler CH service valves are open. • Check the flexible filling loop is connected. • Locate the filling valve handle ( 1 ) and open. • Locate the filling valve handle ( 2 ) and open to allow water to enter the system. Starting with the lowest radiator, open the radiator air release until water (clear of bubbles) is emitted.  Start-up 6

Installation and maintenance instructions ecoTEC exclusive 0020017768_05 24  • Repeat this at all radiators until the complete system is full, all air locks have been cleared and the boiler pressure gauge reads 1.5 bar. Release any air from the pump by slackening the centre screw. Turn off the filling valve ( 2 ) and fully close filling valve ( 1 ). • The boiler is equipped with an automatic air release valve. To allow this to vent the boiler, the cap on the top must be slackened by 1 –2 turns (This cap must be left slackened during boiler operation to ensure any residual air or system gases are released). • Check the heating system and boiler connections are sound.  h   Note! Use the test programme P.0 to vent the boiler and the heating system: The unit does not start in heating mode, the heating pump switches on and off and alternately vents the heating circuit and the hot water circuit, see Section 9.2. 6.1.2   First flushing of the system  h   Note! The entire heating system must be flushed through completely at least twice: once cold and once hot, in accordance with the following instructions.  • Check if all radiator thermostat valves and both maintenance cocks on the boiler are open. • Connect a hose to the drain valve which is located at the lowest position in the heating system. • Open the 1/2" KFE drain cocks and all the vent valves on the radiators so that the water flows quickly and completely out of the heating system and the boiler, in order to remove the contamination caused during the installation out of the heating system before the boiler is started up. • Close the 1/2” KFE drain cocks. • Re-fill the heating system with water as described in Section 6.1.1. • Check that the over-pressure valve in the heating system is functioning correctly by turning the handle on the valve. • Check the pressure in the heating system and top up with water if necessary. • Close filling valve 1 and filling valve 2.  6.1.3   Filling and bleeding from the hot water side  • Open the cold water stop cock on the appliance on the inlet combination. • Fill the hot water system by opening all the hot water taps until water comes out. • As soon as water comes out of all the hot water taps, the hot water circuit is filled completely and also vented.  6.1.4   Filling the condense trap  1  Fig. 6.4 Filling the condense trap  d   Danger! If the appliance is started up with an unfilled condense trap, there is a danger of poisoning by exhaust gas emission.

The burner anti-cycle time is only activated for the heating operation. Hot water operation during a burner anti-cycle time does not affect the timer. The individual anti-cycle time can be matched to the hydraulic and thermal properties of the heating installation. In the factory the burner anti-cycle time is set to a value of 20 minutes. It can be varied under diagnosis point " d.02 " within the range 2 minutes to 60 minutes. The individual effective anti-cycle time is calculated from the momentary target feed temperature and the set maximum burner anti-cycle time. The timer can be reset or cancelled by actuating the appliance main switch. The remaining burner anti-cycle time left after switching off by the controller in heating operation can   be   called up under diagnosis point " d.67 ". The individually effective burner anti-cycle times with respect to the feed temperature and the maximum set burner anti-cycle time can be taken from Table 7.2.  7.2.6   Determination of the maintenance interval/ maintenance display  The electronics of the ecoTEC exclusive allow you to determine the maintenance intervals for the appliance. This function serves to provide a signal that, after a specific, adjustable, number of burner operating hours, the boiler needs to be serviced. The service signal   SEr   is shown in the display of the ecoTEC exclusive alternately with the current pressure after expiry of the set number of burner operating hours. The display also appears on the VRT 360 and 400 (accessories).  Heat demand   Number of persons Burner operating hours to the next inspection/service (dependent upon the type of appliance)  32 kW   3 - 4 4 - 6 2.800 h 2.900 h 38 kW   4 - 6 4 - 8 3.000 h 3.100 h  Table 7.3 Guide values for operating hours  The operating hours to the next service can be set under diagnosis point " d.84 ". Guide values can be taken from Table 7.3; these values correspond to an approximate operating time for the appliance of one year. The operating hours can be set in steps of ten from 0 to 3000 h. If there is no number in the diagnosis point " d.84 ", but there is the symbol " - ", then the "maintenance display" is not active.  h   Note! After the set number of hours have expired, the service interval must be entered in the diagnosis mode again.  Adapting the appliance to the heating system 7

33 Installation and maintenance instructions ecoTEC exclusive 0020017768_05 Inspection and maintenance 8  8   Inspection and maintenance 8.1   Inspection and maintenance intervals Danger! Risk of injury and risk of damage to property due to neglected inspection and maintenance! Neglected inspection and maintenance works or not observing the stated inspection and maintenance intervals can interfere with the operational safety of the boiler and can result in damage to property and to persons. • Point out to the operator that he must observe the demanded inspection and maintenance intervals as a minimum. • Carry out proper regular inspections once a year. • Carry out regular maintenance as dictated by findings during the inspection process. The frequency of maintenance must not be longer than every 5 years. Danger! Danger of life and limb due to improper inspection/maintenance! Inspections/Maintenance work carried out improperly can result in leakages and explosion. • The boiler may only be inspected/maintained by a competent person.  All service work must be carried out by a competent person in accordance with the Gas safety, installation and use regulations. In the UK this is considered to be a person approved at the time by the Health and Safety Executive. In addition BS 6798: 2009 “Specification for installation and maintenance of gas-fired boilers of rated input not exceeding 70 kW net” advises that: - The person carrying out a combustion measurement must be assessed as competent in the use of a flue gas analyser and the interpretation of the results. - The flue gas analyser used must be one meeting the requirements of BS7927 or BS-EN50379-3 and be calibrated in accordance with the analyser manufacturers’ requirements. - Competence can be demonstrated by satisfactory completion of the relevant ACS standard assessment, which covers the use of electronic portable flue gas analysers’ in accordance with BS 7967, parts 1 to 4. - The flue gas analyser is set to the correct fuel setting. We recommend the conclusion of an inspection and maintenance contract with an approved company or installer. The inspection serves to determine the actual condition of the respective boiler and compare it with the specified condition. This is done by measuring, checking and observing. Maintenance is required in order to eliminate any deviations of the actual condition from the specified condition. This normally is done by cleaning, adjustment and, if necessary, replacing individual components that are subject to wear. You must carry out an annual inspection of the Vaillant ecoTEC. It is possible to perform a quick, accurate inspection without removing components by requesting data from the DIA system, carrying out the simple visual checks indicated in Table 8.2 and performing a flue gas measurement. The maintenance intervals (at least once every 5 years) and their scope are determined by the heating engineer based on the condition of the boiler found during the inspection. All inspection and maintenance work should be performed in the order specified in Table 8.2.  d   Danger! Possible poisoning and burning by escaping hot flue gases! It is possible that hot flue gases escape and could result in poisoning or burning, if the boiler is operated - without a completely installed air/flue gas duct - with an opened air/flue gas duct - with internal leakages and an opened front casing. • Operate the boiler - for commissioning - for testing purposes - in continuous mode only with closed front casing and completely mounted and closed air/flue gas duct. 8.1.1   General inspection and maintenance instructions  To ensure the faultless operation, long term availability of all functions and long working life of your Vaillant boiler and to prevent modifications to the approved series status only genuine Vaillant spare parts must be used when carrying out inspection, maintenance and repair work. For an overview of the available original Vaillant spare parts, contact the Vaillant sales office on 01634 292310. During any inspection and maintenance or after change of parts of the combustion circuit, the following must be checked: - The appliance has been installed in accordance with the relevant installation instructions. - The integrity of the flue gas installation and flue seals is in accordance with the relevant flue installation instructions enclosed. - Visual, the integrity of the boiler combustion circuit and relevant seals. - The gas inlet working pressure at maximum rate as described in Section 6.2.3.
