expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,1,# Expansion Vessel Failure: Diagnosis and Solutions
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,2,
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,3,"This guide addresses the specific scenario where boiler pressure rapidly increases during operation until the pressure relief valve (PRV) activates, a classic symptom of expansion vessel failure."
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,4,
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,5,## Understanding the Problem
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,6,
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,7,### Normal Operation vs. Failure Mode
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,8,
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,9,**Normal Expansion Vessel Function:**
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,10,- The expansion vessel contains a rubber diaphragm separating an air chamber from the water side
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,11,"- When water heats and expands, it compresses the air cushion"
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,12,- Pressure increases are gradual and typically limited to 0.2-0.5 bar above cold fill pressure
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,13,- System maintains stable pressure within safe operating range (typically 1-2 bar)
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,14,
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,15,**Failure Mode:**
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,16,"- When the expansion vessel fails, there is no air cushion to absorb expansion"
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,17,"- As water heats, pressure rises rapidly and dramatically"
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,18,"- Pressure quickly reaches 3 bar, triggering the pressure relief valve"
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,19,- Water is discharged through the PRV outside the property
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,20,"- When system cools, pressure drops significantly, potentially causing boiler lockout"
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,21,
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,22,## Key Symptoms of Expansion Vessel Failure
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,23,
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,24,1. **Rapid Pressure Increase**
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,25,   - Pressure gauge shows quick rise to 3+ bar shortly after boiler starts
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,26,   - Rise is much faster than in normal operation (minutes rather than hours)
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,27,
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,28,2. **Pressure Relief Valve Activation**
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,29,   - Water discharging from external PRV pipe
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,30,   - Often accompanied by audible release of pressure
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,31,   - Repeated discharge cycles with boiler use
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,32,
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,33,3. **Pressure Cycling**
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,34,"   - High pressure during operation, followed by significant drops when cooled"
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,35,   - Need to frequently top up system pressure
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,36,   - Boiler may lock out on low pressure after cooling
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,37,
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,38,4. **Supporting Symptoms**
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,39,   - Expansion vessel makes dull sound when tapped (should sound hollow)
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,40,   - System may be several years old (diaphragms typically last 5-8 years)
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,41,   - History of inhibitor loss or previous pressure issues
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,42,
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,43,## Diagnostic Procedure
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,44,
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,45,### 1. Initial Assessment
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,46,
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,47,**Visual Inspection:**
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,48,- Check the pressure gauge reading with system cold (should be 1-1.5 bar)
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,49,- Look for water stains or dampness around PRV discharge pipe
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,50,- Inspect expansion vessel for external damage or corrosion
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,51,
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,52,**Operational Test:**
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,53,- Monitor pressure gauge as system heats up
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,54,- Time how quickly pressure rises to 3 bar
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,55,- Normal: Slow rise of 0.2-0.5 bar over extended period
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,56,- Failed vessel: Rapid rise to 3+ bar within minutes
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,57,
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,58,### 2. Expansion Vessel Testing
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,59,
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,60,**Preliminary Sound Test:**
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,61,- With system cold and at normal pressure
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,62,- Tap the side of the expansion vessel
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,63,"- A properly functioning vessel makes a hollow, resonant sound"
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,64,"- A failed vessel makes a dull, solid sound (""plunk"" rather than ""ping"")"
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,65,
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,66,**Valve Test:**
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,67,1. Turn off boiler and electrical supply
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,68,2. Allow system to cool completely
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,69,3. Ensure system pressure is above 1 bar
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,70,4. Locate the Schrader valve on expansion vessel (similar to car tire valve)
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,71,5. Remove protective cap
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,72,6. Use a small tool to briefly depress the valve pin
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,73,7. Observe what comes out:
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,74,   - **Air only:** Vessel may be functional but undercharged
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,75,   - **Water:** Diaphragm has definitely failed - vessel needs replacement
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,76,   - **Nothing:** Air charge is depleted - may be recoverable or may indicate failure
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,77,
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,78,### 3. Pressure Charge Test
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,79,
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,80,**Equipment needed:**
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,81,- Tire pressure gauge
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,82,- Bicycle pump or compressor with Schrader valve attachment
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,83,- Drain key or valve
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,84,
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,85,**Procedure:**
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,86,1. Turn off and electrically isolate the boiler
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,87,2. Connect a pressure gauge to the Schrader valve
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,88,3. Record the reading - should be approximately 0.1-0.3 bar below cold fill pressure
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,89,"   - Example: If cold fill pressure is 1.2 bar, vessel charge should be around 0.9-1.1 bar"
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,90,"4. If reading is much lower, vessel may need recharging"
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,91,"5. If reading fluctuates or won't register, diaphragm has likely failed"
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,92,
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,93,### 4. Definitive Charge Test (Professional)
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,94,
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,95,This test definitively determines vessel condition:
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,96,
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,97,1. Turn off and isolate boiler
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,98,2. Drain down system to zero pressure (use drain valve)
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,99,3. **Keep drain valve open** during test
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,100,4. Connect pump to expansion vessel valve
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,101,5. Pump up to 0.75-1 bar (or manufacturer's specification)
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,102,6. Observe:
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,103,   - **Holds pressure:** Vessel diaphragm is intact and may be recoverable
expansion_vessel_diagnosis.md,104,   - **Can't reach target pressure or air bubbles into system:** Diaphragm has failed
