heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,1,# Diagnostic Guide: Identifying Heat Exchanger Leaks and Splits
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,2,
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,3,This guide provides detailed procedures for detecting internal splits in plate heat exchangers and leaks in main heat exchangers - two critical but sometimes difficult-to-diagnose issues in combi boilers.
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,4,
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,5,## PART 1: IDENTIFYING INTERNAL SPLITS IN PLATE HEAT EXCHANGERS
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,6,
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,7,"An internal split in a plate heat exchanger is particularly problematic as it allows water from the primary circuit to mix with domestic hot water, potentially introducing system water (containing inhibitors and contaminants) into the drinking water supply."
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,8,
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,9,### Common Symptoms of a Split Plate Heat Exchanger
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,10,
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,11,1. **Water Quality Issues**
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,12,   - Discolored water from hot taps only (often a blue/green tint from corrosion inhibitor)
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,13,   - Metallic or unusual taste in hot water only
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,14,   - Debris or particles in hot water that aren't present in cold water
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,15,
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,16,2. **System Pressure Changes**
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,17,   - Unexplained and recurring drop in system pressure
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,18,   - Need to frequently top up the system
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,19,   - Pressure drops specifically when hot water is being used
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,20,
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,21,3. **Performance Anomalies**
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,22,   - Hot water temperature fluctuations not related to flow rate
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,23,   - System pressure increases when hot water taps are opened
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,24,   - Heating activates or deactivates when hot water is used
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,25,
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,26,### Diagnostic Tests for Internal PHE Splits
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,27,
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,28,#### 1. Primary Pressure Test
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,29,

heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,40,4. Draw off hot water from a tap for 30 seconds
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,41,5. Check the pressure gauge again
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,42,6. A significant drop in pressure (>0.2 bar) indicates potential internal leak
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,43,
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,44,#### 2. Cross-Contamination Visual Test
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,45,

heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,79,3. Run hot water tap and observe pressure readings
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,80,4. Normal differential should be steady (0.5-1.0 bar typically)
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,81,5. Fluctuating readings or abnormal differential suggests internal problem
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,82,
heat_exchanger_leak_diagnosis.md,83,### Advanced Diagnostic: Hydraulic Pressure Test
